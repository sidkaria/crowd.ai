## Set up (React Native using Expo):
1. Download and install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) LTS
2. Follow [Steps here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) under the `React Native CLI Quickstart` tab
3. `cd` into the project directory
4. Run `npm install` to install node modules
6. Run `npx react-native run-ios` or `npx react-native run-android`

Note: only Android will work for an external device as well as an emulator; you will have to use a simulator for iOS.
